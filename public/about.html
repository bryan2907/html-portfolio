<h1>About Bryan</h1>
<p>An old professional shaking up his knowledge whenever he gets a free moment.
  Some of the web technology and app tools are amazing but they all have their
  limitations which you usually only find out about after signing up.<p>

<p>I want a web page that delivers more than just a 'shop window' and that really
  engages with clients and becomes part of how we do business together in tax and
  and real estate consultancy - a portal or hub with standardised forms to comply
  with regulation (e.g. Anti-Money Laundering), stores important project documentation
  for reference to aide disclosure, transparency and reporting requirements; with tips
  and tailored learning tools 
</p>

</p>By getting into the details of how web development actually works I hope to
not only learn valuable new skills but also more confidentally engage with the
development community for more spohisticated app development; and perhaps, even
manage to develop a great website for my own consultancy business on the way.<p>

<p>
  I also want to explore some web app ideas I have had for ages that bring in both 
  my real estate, tax and finance expertise as a Chartered Surveyor (MSc BSc MRICs)
  and tax practitioner (ATT - Fellow) to make it easier and simpler for ordinary 
  homeowners to engage with other construction professionals and builders to  
  manage their home build projects confidentally and get the works they dream of.
